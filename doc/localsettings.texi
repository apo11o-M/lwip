@macro localmachines{}
The CS 3204 ``officially supported''
Pintos development machines are the remote Linux cluster.
You can log on to those machines remotely using
@example
ssh -Y yourlogin@@rlogin.cs.vt.edu
@end example
@end macro

@macro localpathsetup{}
Under @command{csh} you can do so with this command:

@example
set path = ( ~cs3204/bin $path )
@end example
@noindent
It is a good idea to add this line to the @file{.cshrc} file
in your home directory.  Otherwise, you'll have to type it every time
you log in.
@command{bash} shell users would instead add
@example
export PATH=~cs3204/bin:$PATH
@end example
@noindent
to their @file{.bash_profile} file.
@end macro

@macro localcrossbuild{}
@c Watch the commands executed during the build.  On the Linux machines,
@c the ordinary system tools are used.  On a SPARC machine, special build
@c tools are used, whose names begin with @samp{i386-elf-}, e.g.@:
@c @code{i386-elf-gcc}, @code{i386-elf-ld}.  These are ``cross-compiler''
@c tools.  That is, the build is running on a SPARC machine (called the
@c @dfn{host}), but the result will run on a simulated 80@var{x}86 machine
@c (called the @dfn{target}).  The @samp{i386-elf-@var{program}} tools are
@c specially built for this configuration.
@end macro

@macro localhonorcodepolicy{}
@c In the context of Stanford's CS 140 course, please respect the spirit
@c and the letter of the honor code by refraining from reading any homework
@c solutions available online or elsewhere.  Reading the source code for
@c other operating system kernels, such as Linux or FreeBSD, is allowed,
@c but do not copy code from them literally.  Please cite the code that
@c inspired your own in your design documentation.
@end macro

@macro localcredits{}
Adjustments for Virginia Tech's CS 3204 were made by Godmar Back.
@end macro

@macro localcvspolicy{}
Instead, we recommend integrating your team's changes early and often,
using the git source code control system (@pxref{git}).
These systems also make it possible to review changes and,
when a change introduces a bug, drop back to working versions of code.

You can decide which model to use: either a shared repository
model in which team partners share access to an upstream repository
kept on git.cs.vt.edu, which in turn is forked from the provided
pintos-2017 repository, or whether you want to use pull request
based model to give other team member a chance to review changes
first.

@c Descriptions of additional, local development tools can be inserted here
In addition, you can set up Cygwin's ssh client for password-less login as 
described earlier. @xref{Setting Up ssh}.
